# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a variable that is defined to the function, the argument is the actual data that is assigned to the parameter.

  Researched answer: A parameter is the variable inside the parentheses in the function definition. An argument is the value given to the function to run through.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() built in predefined parameters take a function as an argument, acts on the array, iterates through the array, and returns the array with the result of the argument.

  Researched answer: The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. The predefined parameter that cannot change is the length of the array returned. The length of the array will always be the same as the array referenced and each element will be run through the function. The predefined parameter that can change is the array of the current element and value passed through the function.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The difference between the Higher Order Functions map and filter is the map built in takes the array and returns an array with the same amount as the original. The filter built in takes the array, acts on the array, iterates through the array, and returns a subset of the array.

  Researched answer: The .map method returns a new array by transforming each individual element in the array given. The returned array is the same amount of the array given. The .filter method returns a new array by removing elements in an array and returning elements according to the functions argument. The returned array is a portion of the array given.   



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is an argument taking objects/variables into account. A method is an argument within an object.

  Researched answer: Functions are sets of code blocks made to execute an action or argument. Functions do not interact with other code unless referencing a variable. Functions are separate from other code blocks. Methods are code blocks within an object. Methods are functions nested within an object, not separate, but interacting with the object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object deconstructing is the process of assigning a key pathway through an object.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is assigning properties from objects or arrays in one variable. It is taking values from an object portperty and assigned to a variable.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is the process to allow functions to be used in code before being hard-coded.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is the behavior of moving variables to the top of the scope. The variable is not yet declared. Hoisting is used to aid, no matter where the functions or variables are declared, they are moved to the top of the scope. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance allows a defined class to take all properties and functions from an established parent class. The child class has the ability to add on more data, as well as keep the functionality of the parent class.

2. React: React is a platform used to build webpages and mobile applications. The platform makes the pages and applications in parts, then bringing all components together to form the full application. Created from Facebook, React is made to be simple and dynamic.

3. React state: React state is an object to store data that belong to a component. The component data renders and behaves according to the data values. Components are dynamic and can re-render with changes and new data.

4. React lifecycle methods: React lifecycle methods are built in methods in React used on components through their duration in the DOM. Three categories of these methods are mounting, updating, and unmounting.

5. DOM: DOM or Document Object Model is the process of web applications interacting with the user. As the user navigates the application, the DOM navigates alongside, changing to represent what the user is interacting with on the application.
